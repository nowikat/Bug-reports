This folder showcases sample bug reports that resulted from my work as a solo software tester on Pletly. These reports cover a wide range of issues, from functional bugs to usability problems, illustrating the various challenges encountered during testing.    
Most of these bugs were discovered during exploratory testing sessions.  
I document each testing session in a Google Doc and share it with the development team for feedback. After incorporating their comments, I create detailed tasks in Shortcut to track the identified bugs.
For an example of my exploratory testing documentation, please refer to this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eLIlwY7Ce5crGJXHHOL0U1t3TtcvpuGC51kOKF8ZLr0/edit?usp=sharing)
